// # JUMP.CFG
// Small config file for the `jump` alias since I couldn't fit both the hurtme and the bind in one alias.

echo "### Loaded config/jump.cfg!"

// And now, for some random research...
// The lowest hurtme value can vary between classes. I've found that the lowest it can be set for each class is the following;
// Scout:    -2147483583
// Soldier:  -2147483456
// Pyro:     -2147483456
// Demoman:  -2147483456
// Heavy:    -2147483327
// Engineer: -2147483583
// Medic:    -2147483456
// Sniper:   -2147483583
// Spy:      -2147483583
// These values were all tested on a vanilla server at base health with loadouts that do not effect the base health of the character.
// It's a little bit above the minimum value for an integer. Not sure what the difference means, if anything.
