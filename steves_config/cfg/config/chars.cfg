echo "This lists the chars that are able to be displayed within the console."
echo "The consoles default font is Lucida Console (size 10px), which means *technically,* it can display any character this font supports."
echo "Executed input is limited to the C++ char datatype, or up to the end of the `Basic Latin` unicode table (aka up to ascii char 0x7F)."
echo "For scripting purposes, anything more than that table is unusable."
